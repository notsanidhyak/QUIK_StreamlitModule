# QUIK Search - Streamlit App

This is the streamlit app for `QUIK Search Engine`. You can run this app to interact with the search engine **(with limited functionality)**. This streamlit app does not have the full functionality of the search engine, as compared to the backend server.

## Installation & Setup

`Python 3.8` or higher is required to run this project. Make sure you have it installed on your system. Once, you have `Python` installed, you can follow the steps below to run the backend.

```shell
cd streamlit
```

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

This should start the streamlit app on the `Network URL` specified in the terminal. You can now interact with the search engine.
